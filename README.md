# polymarket-trends

A real-time interactive dashboard that visualizes trending prediction markets from Polymarket. Tracks daily changes in probability, volume, and sentiment, generating an intuitive "market heat index" to reveal collective intelligence and emerging global narratives.

## Getting Started

This repository is meant to host a web dashboard application. To bootstrap a clean and responsive dashboard with charts and UI components, we recommend using the [Spike Next.js Free Admin Template](https://github.com/wrappixel/spike-nextjs-free). It is built with Next.js and Material UI and comes with built‑in ApexCharts integration for interactive data visualization.

### Recommended setup

1. **Clone the template**: Clone the Spike Next.js template locally by running:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wrappixel/spike-nextjs-free.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd spike-nextjs-free
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start a local development server on `http://localhost:3000` where you can explore the template’s pages and components.

4. **Adapt for Polymarket data**: Replace the placeholder chart data with real-time data from the Polymarket API. You can customize the charts (powered by ApexCharts) to visualize probabilities, volumes, and sentiment indices.

5. **Push to this repository**: Once you’ve customized the template, replace the existing files in this repository with your new Next.js project and push the changes.
